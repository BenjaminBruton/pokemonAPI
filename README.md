# pokemonAPI

This is a simple GET API with 150 Pokemon pre-loaded.
Just as the home page suggests, you can append /pokemon to the end to receive a JSON object containing the count and all 150 Pokemon
or drill down further with /pokemon/id to get a specific Pokemon. Example: /pokemon/66 would receive {"id":66,"name":"kingler"}
